## Description

With minigame masters, you will create a profile with a username, email, and password. You can then pick a game from a selection of both single player games and multiplayer games. When playing multiplayer games, you can create a room and by providing that room name to someone else, you can play with anybody. You earn coins as you play and you can see the leaderboards, where you can see who has the most coins. We simply wanted to create a site where users can have fun playing simple games!!
